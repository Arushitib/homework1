What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merge: When you merge one branch into another, it creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. 
Rebase: When you rebase a branch onto another, it rewrites the commit history of the rebased branch.

What is a remote repository?
Remote repositories areÂ versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
